#Gillie-Lace - Micro CSS Responsive Framework

```
gil·lie - /ˈgilē/ -- a type of shoe with laces along the instep and no tongue, especially those used for Scottish country dancing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghillies_(dance)">Gillies</a>
```

Gillie-Lace is designed to be a micro-framework alternative to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>. It is designed to provide the absolute essentials to start a responsive website. Don't be fooled, behind the 4K minified css is 100K of kilts, bagpipes and bad@$$ery.
